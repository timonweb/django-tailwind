# Welcome to Django Tailwind's documentation!

# Definitions

This document uses the term *Tailwind* to refer to two things: the CSS framework and the Django package.

To avoid confusion, we'll use:
* **Django Tailwind** when referring to this package;
* **Tailwind CSS** when referring to the CSS framework.

**Django Tailwind** was created to integrate **Tailwind CSS** with Django (ðŸ’š).
